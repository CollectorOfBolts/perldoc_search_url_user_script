# Perldoc Search URL Userscript
A script to allow searching the new Perldoc site via URL

## How To
1. Add the script to Tampermonkey or another user script browser extension
2. Add a search engine to your browser with a search URL of https://perldoc.perl.org/5.30.0/?q=%s 
    1. Note that the Perl version is currently needed in the URL as the Perldoc site's search does not work without it ( https://github.com/OpusVL/perldoc.perl.org/issues/56 )
